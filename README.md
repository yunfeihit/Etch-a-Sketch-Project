I'm working on a project to build a website called 'Etch-a-Sketch'. 
I'll use flex box to create pixelated grid in which when the mouse move over create a painting effect. 
The 'Sketch' should also has some addition function like 'rainbow(changes filling color random rather than just black)' and 'darken effect(implement a progressive darken effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10% )'.
Wish me luck!
